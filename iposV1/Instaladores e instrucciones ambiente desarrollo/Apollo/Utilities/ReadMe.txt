The FREE Apollo Utilities are not automatically included with each Apollo 
product download because it would add an extra 5MB to each download. 
Simply go to the following url and download the latest version manually:

This directory contains fully working LITE versions of the two most popular 
database utilities for Apollo:

	DBF-Desktop LITE 
	Scott Martin (Sendero Software)
	http://www.senderosoftware.com

	dbfUtils LITE 
	Del Geist (GW Associates)
	http://www.dbfutils.com

These utilities allow Apollo developers to visually create and modify DBF 
file structures and they allow data to be visually entered and modified 
as well. You may use utilities to create and manage your Apollo DBF data 
files only. You may NOT redistribute these utilities with your applications. 
That would violate both products' license agreements. 

If you find these products useful, we encourage you to purchase the full 
versions from the respective authors, which offer even more power and 
features. The full versions of both utilities are very affordable and both 
are well worth the investment! Documentation is available with the 
registered versions of these products.
